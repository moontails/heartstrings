# heartstrings & hope : the tale of two blades

greetings traveler! 

this repo is my experiement in testing out writing a fantasy fiction story, blog style. 
this is also aimed as an exercise to develop a writing consistency.

in parallel, i am also "developing" this blog in the most over-engineered way imaginable, 
the intention is to turn it into something that can be plug and play for others to start blogging and tell their stories!

let's go! ðŸ¤ž
