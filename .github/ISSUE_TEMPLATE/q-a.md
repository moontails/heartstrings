**Description**
lets use github issues if you have any feedback to share with the author or seek clarification or talk about any reasonable topic. 

note - unrelated issues will be marked as such and may end up being ignored or deleted.

**Just to make it a bit more interesting - add a fun fact about you or anything you wanna share!**
please exercise good judgement
